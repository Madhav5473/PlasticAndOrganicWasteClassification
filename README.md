# PlasticAndOrganicWasteClassification
This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project aimed at classifying images of waste into two categories: Organic Waste (O) and Recyclable Plastic Waste (R). The project is part of an internship focused on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to tackle the growing problem of waste segregation.
